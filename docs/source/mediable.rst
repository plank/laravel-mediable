Handling Media
==============

.. highlight:: php

Add the ``Mediable`` trait to any Eloquent models that you would like to be able to attach media to.

::

    <?php

    namespace App;

    use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;
    use Plank\Mediable\Mediable;

    class Post extends Model
    {
        use Mediable;

        // ...
    }

Attaching Media
--------------------------

You can attach media to your ``Mediable`` model using the ``attachMedia()`` method. This method takes a second argument, specifying one or more tags which define the relationship between the model and the media. Tags are simply strings; you can use any value you need to describe how the model should use its attached media.

::

    <?php
    $post = Post::first();
    $post->attachMedia($media, 'thumbnail');

You can attach multiple media to the same tag with a single call. The ``attachMedia()`` method accept any of the following for its first parameter:

- a numeric or string id
- an instance of ``\Plank\Mediable\Media``
- an array of ids
- an instance of ``\Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Collection``

::

    <?php
    $post->attachMedia([$media1->getKey(), $media2->getKey()], 'gallery');

You can also assign media to multiple tags with a single call.

::

    <?php
    $post->attachMedia($media, ['gallery', 'featured']);


Replacing Media
--------------------------

``Media`` and ``Mediable`` models share a many-to-many relationship, which allows for any number of media to be added to any key. The ``attachMedia()`` method will add a new association, but will not remove any existing associations to other media. If you want to replace the media previously attached to the specified tag(s) you can use the ``syncMedia()`` method. This method accepts the same inputs as ``attachMedia()``.

::

    <?php
    $post->syncMedia($media, 'thumbnail');

Retrieving Media
--------------------------

You can retrieve media attached to a file by referring to the tag to which it was previously assigned.

::

    <?php
    $media = $post->getMedia('thumbnail');

This returns a collection of all media assigned to that tag. In cases where you only need one ``Media`` entity, you can instead use ``firstMedia()`` or ``lastMedia()``.

::

    <?php
    $media = $post->firstMedia('thumbnail');
    // shorthand for
    $media = $post->getMedia('thumbnail')->first();

If you specify an array of tags, the method will return media is attached to any of those tags. Set the ``$match_all`` parameter to ``true`` to tell the method to only return media that are attached to all of the specified tags.

::

    <?php
    $post->getMedia(['header', 'footer']); // get media with either tag
    $post->getMedia(['header', 'footer'], true); //get media with both tags
    $post->getMediaMatchAll(['header', 'footer']); //alias

You can also get all media attached to a model, grouped by tag.

::

    <?php
    $post->getAllMediaByTag();

Media Order
--------------------------

The system keeps track of the order in which ``Media`` are attached to each ``Mediable`` model's tags and are always returned in the same order.

To change the order of media assigned to a given tag, or to insert a new item at a particular index manipulate the eloquent collection then use the ``syncMedia()`` method to commit the changes.

::

    <?php
    $media = $post->getMedia('gallery');
    $media = $media->prepend($new_media);
    $post->syncMedia($media, 'gallery');

An ``ORDER BY`` clause is automatically applied to all queries run on the ``media()`` relationship. To disable this default behaviour, use the ``unordered()`` query scope.

::

    <?php
    $mediable->media()
        ->unordered()
        ->...


Checking for the Presence of Media
----------------------------------

You can verify if a model has one or more media assigned to a given tag with the ``hasMedia()`` method.

::

    <?php
    if($post->hasMedia('thumbnail')){
        // ...
    }

You can specify multiple tags when calling either method, which functions similarly to ``getMedia()``. The method will return ``true`` if ``getMedia()`` passed the same parameters would return any instances.

You also can also perform this check using the query builder.

::

    <?php
    $posts = Post::whereHasMedia('thumbnail')->get();

Detaching Media
--------------------------

You can remove a media record from a model with the ``detachMedia()`` method.

::

    <?php
    $post->detachMedia($media); // remove media from all tags
    $post->detachMedia($media, 'feature'); //remove media from specific tag
    $post->detachMedia($media, ['feature', 'thumbnail']); //remove media from multiple tags


You can also remove all media assigned to one or more tags.

::

    <?php
    $post->detachMediaTags('feature');
    $post->detachMediaTags(['feature', 'thumbnail']);

Loading Media
--------------------------

When dealing with any model relationships, taking care to avoid running into the "N+1 problem" is an important optimization consideration. The N+1 problem can be summed up as a separate query being run for the related content of each record of the parent model. Consider the following example:

::

    <?php
    $posts = Post::limit(10)->get();
    foreach($posts as $post){
        echo $post->firstMedia('thumbnail')->getUrl();
    }

Assuming there are at least 10 Post records available, this code will execute 11 queries: one query to load the 10 posts from the database, then another 10 queries to load the media for each of the post records individually. This will slow down the rendering of the page.

There are a couple of approaches that can be taken to preload the attached media in order to avoid this issue.

Eager Loading
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Eloquent query builder's ``with()`` method is the preferred way to eager load related models. This package also provides an alias.

::

    <?php
    $posts = Post::with('media')->get();
    // or
    $posts = Post::withMedia()->get();

You can also load only media attached to specific tags.

::

    <?php
    $posts = Post::withMedia(['thumbnail', 'featured']); // attached to either tags
    $posts = Post::withMediaMatchAll(['thumbnail', 'featured']); // attached to both tags

**Note**: if using this approach to conditionally preload media by tag, you will not be able to access media with other tags using ``getMedia()`` without first reloading the media relationship on that record.

Lazy Eager Loading
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you have already loaded models from the database, you can still load relationships with the ``load()`` method of the Eloquent Collection class. The package also provides an alias.

::

    <?php
    $posts = Post::all();
    // ...

    $posts->load('media');
    // or
    $posts->loadMedia();


You can also load only media attached to specific tags.

::

    <?php
    $posts->loadMedia(['thumbnail', 'featured']); // attached to either tag
    $posts->loadMediaMatchAll(['thumbnail', 'featured']); // attached to both tags


The same method is available as part of the ``Mediable`` trait, and can be used directly on a model instance.

::

    <?php
    $post = Post::first();
    $post->loadMedia();
    $post->loadMedia(['thumbnail', 'featured']); // attached to either tag
    $post->loadMediaMatchAll(['thumbnail', 'featured']); // attached to both tags


Any of these methods can be used to reload the media relationship of the model.

**Note**: if using this approach to conditionally preload media by tag, you will not be able to access media with other tags using ``getMedia()`` without first reloading the media relationship on that record.

Automatic Rehydration
----------------------

By default, ``Mediable`` models will automatically reload their media relationship the next time the media at a given tag is accessed after that tag is modified.

The ``attachMedia()``, ``syncMedia()``, ``detachMedia()``, and ``detachMediaTags()`` methods will mark any tags passed as being dirty, while the ``hasMedia()`` ``getMedia()``, ``firstMedia()``, ``lastMedia()``, ``getAllMediaByTag()``, and ``getTagsForMedia()`` methods will execute ``loadMedia()`` to reload all media if they attempt to read a dirty tag.

For example:

::

    <?php
    $post->loadMedia();
    $post->getMedia('gallery'); // returns an empty collection
    $post->getMedia('thumbnail'); // returns an empty collection
    $post->attachMedia($media, 'gallery'); // marks the gallery tag as dirty

    $post->getMedia('thumbnail'); // still returns an empty collection
    $post->getMedia('gallery'); // performs a `loadMedia()`, returns a collection with $media

You can enable or disable this behaviour on a class-by-class basis by adding the ``$rehydrates_media`` property to your ``Mediable`` model.

::

    <?php
    // ...

    class Post extends Model
    {
        use Mediable;

        protected $rehydrates_media = false;

        // ...
    }

You can also set the application-wide default behaviour in ``config/mediable.php``.

::

    'rehydrate_media' => true,

Deleting Mediables
--------------------

You can delete mediable model with standard Eloquent model ``delete()`` method. This will also detach any associated ``Mediable`` models.

::

    <?php
    $post->delete();


**Note**: The ``delete()`` method on the query builder *will not* purge media relationships.

::

    <?php
    Media::where(...)->delete(); //will not detach relationships

Soft Deletes
^^^^^^^^^^^^

If your ``Mediable`` class uses Laravel's ``SoftDeletes`` trait, the model will only detach its media relationships if ``forceDelete()`` is used.

You can change the ``detach_on_soft_delete`` setting to ``true`` in ``config/mediable.php`` to have relationships automatically detach when either the ``Media`` record or ``Mediable`` model are soft deleted.

Custom Mediables Table
----------------------

By default the ``mediables`` table is used to for the media-to-mediables relationship. You can change this in ``config/mediable.php``:

::

    /*
     * Name to be used for mediables joining table
     */
    'mediables_table' => 'prefixed_mediables',
