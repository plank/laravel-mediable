Uploading Files
============================================

.. highlight:: php

The easiest way to upload media to your server is with the ``MediaUploader`` class, which handles validating the file, moving it to its destination and creating a ``Media`` record to reference it. You can get an instance of the MediaUploader using the Facade and configure it with a fluent interface.

To upload a file to the root of the default disk (set in ``config/mediable.php``), all you need to do is the following:
::

    <?php
    use MediaUploader; //use the facade
    $media = MediaUploader::fromSource($request->file('thumbnail'))->upload();

Source Files
----------------------

The ``fromSource()`` method will accept any of the following:

- an instance of ``Symfony\Component\HttpFoundation\UploadedFile``, which is returned by ``$request->file()``.
- an instance of ``Symfony\Component\HttpFoundation\File``.
- a URL as a string, beginning with ``http://`` or ``https://``.
- an absolute path as a string, beginning with ``/``.

Specifying Destination
----------------------

By default, the uploader will place the file in the root of the default disk specified in ``config/mediable.php``. You can customize where the uploader will put the file on your server before you invoke the ``upload()`` method.

::

    <?php
    $uploader = MediaUploader::fromSource($request->file('thumbnail'))

    // specify a disk to use instead of the default
    ->toDisk('s3');

    // place the file in a directory relative to the disk root
    ->toDirectory('user/john/profile')

    // alternatively, specify both the disk and directory at once
    ->toDestination('s3', 'user/john/profile')

    ->upload();

Specifying Filename
--------------------

By default, the uploader will copy the source file while maintaining its original filename. You can override this behaviour by providing a custom filename.

::

    <?php
    MediaUploader::fromSource(...)
        ->useFilename('profile')
        ->upload();

You can also tell the uploader to generate a filename based on the MD5 hash of the file's contents.

::

    <?php
    MediaUploader::fromSource(...)
        ->useHashForFilename()
        ->upload();

You can restore the default behaviour with ``useOriginalFilename()``.

Handling Duplicates
----------------------

Occasionally, a file with a matching name might already exist at the destination you would like to upload to. The uploader allows you to configure how it should respond to this scenario. There are three possible behaviours:

::

    <?php

    // keep both, append incrementing counter to new file name
    $uploader->onDuplicateIncrement();

    // replace old file with new one
    $uploader->onDuplicateReplace();

    // cancel upload, throw an exception
    $uploader->onDuplicateError();


Validation
--------------------

The ``MediaUpload`` will perform a number of validation checks on the source file. If any of the checks fail, a ``Plank\Mediable\MediaUploaderException`` will be through with a message indicating why the file was rejected.


You can override the most validation configuration values set in ``config/mediable.php`` on a case-by-case basis using the same fluent interface.

::

    <?php
    $media = MediaUploader::fromSource($request->file('image'))

        // model class to use
        ->setModelClass(MediaSubclass::class)

        // maximum filesize in bytes
        ->setMaximumSize(99999)

        // whether the aggregate type must match both the MIME type and extension
        ->setStrictTypeChecking(true)

        // whether to allow the 'other' aggregate type
        ->setAllowUnrecognizedTypes(true)

        // only allow files of specific MIME types
        ->setAllowedMimeTypes(['image/jpeg'])

        // only allow files of specifc extensions
        ->setAllowedExtensions(['jpg', 'jpeg'])

        // only allow files of specific aggregate types
        ->setAllowedAggregateTypes(['image'])

        ->upload();

Importing Files
--------------------

If you need to create a media record for a file that is already in place on the desired filesystem disk, you can use one the import methods instead.

::

    <?php
    $media = MediaUploader::import($disk, $directory, $filename, $extension);
    // or
    $media = MediaUploader::importPath($disk, $path);


Updating Files
---------------

If a file has changed on disk, you can re-evaluate its attributes with the ``update()`` method. This will reassign the media record's ``mime_type``, ``aggregate_type`` and ``size`` attributes and will save the changes to the database, if any.

::

    <?php
    MediaUploader::update($media);
